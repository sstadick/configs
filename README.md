This is my collection of dotfiles

Usage

Pull the repository, and then create the symbolic links [using GNU
stow](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sstadick/configs.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ stow fish neovim tmux # plus whatever else you'd like
```
